 image and object recognition tasks involve the classification and localization of objects within images. Python, combined with deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, provides powerful tools for designing and executing experiments for these tasks. Below is a general explanation of how to set up an image and object recognition experiment using Python in deep learning.
